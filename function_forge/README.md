# The Function Forge

**Quest Objective:**  
Learn to define and use functions in C, including passing arguments and pointers.

**Lore:**  
The apprentice now learns to forge reusable rituals — functions that accept parameters and return results. With pointer-passing, memory itself becomes mutable across realms.

**Concepts Unlocked:**
- Function definition and calls
- Parameter passing by value and by reference
- Pointer-based modification (`int* power`)
- Modular design and reuse

**Bonus Challenge:**  
Create a function that calculates and returns a spell’s efficiency (power divided by cost). Use it to compare multiple spells.
