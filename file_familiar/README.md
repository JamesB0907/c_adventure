# The File Familiar

**Quest Objective:**  
Learn to read and write data using file I/O in C.

**Lore:**  
The apprentice now binds their rituals to scrolls — inscribing spell data to disk and summoning it when needed. This is the foundation of save files, configuration systems, and persistent memory.

**Concepts Unlocked:**
- `FILE*` — file pointer
- `fopen`, `fclose` — opening and closing files
- `fprintf`, `fscanf` — writing and reading formatted data
- File modes: `"w"` for writing, `"r"` for reading

**Bonus Challenge:**  
Allow the user to add new spells interactively, then append them to the spellbook file.
