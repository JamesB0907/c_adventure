# The Dynamic Depths

**Quest Objective:**  
Learn to allocate and free memory dynamically using `malloc` and `free`.

**Lore:**  
The apprentice now learns to summon memory from the void — crafting arrays that grow and shrink at runtime. This power comes with great responsibility: memory must be released when its purpose is fulfilled.

**Concepts Unlocked:**
- `malloc` — allocate memory dynamically
- `sizeof(int)` — calculate memory size per element
- `free` — release memory back to the system
- `NULL` check — verify successful allocation

**Bonus Challenge:**  
Allow the user to input custom mana values for each crystal, then sort them from weakest to strongest.
