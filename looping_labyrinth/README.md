# The Looping Labyrinth

**Quest Objective:**  
Learn to repeat actions using the three sacred loops of C.

**Lore:**  
The apprentice must navigate the labyrinth of repetition, where each path offers a different rhythm of control. Mastery of these loops grants power over time and flow.

**Concepts Unlocked:**
- `for` loop — structured repetition with known bounds
- `while` loop — repetition based on a condition
- `do-while` loop — guaranteed one-time execution before checking

**Bonus Challenge:**  
Add input validation: if the user enters a number less than 1, prompt them again until they enter a valid number.
