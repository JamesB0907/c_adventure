# The Struct Scroll

**Quest Objective:**  
Learn to define and use `structs` to group related data.

**Lore:**  
The apprentice now inscribes their own scrolls — crafting custom types that bind multiple properties into a single entity. This is the foundation of character sheets, game entities, and data architecture.

**Concepts Unlocked:**
- `struct Spell` — defining a custom data type
- `strcpy` — copying strings into struct fields
- Dot notation (`fireball.power`) — accessing struct members

**Bonus Challenge:**  
Create an array of `Spell` structs and loop through them to display a full spellbook.
