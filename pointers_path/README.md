# The Pointer’s Path

**Quest Objective:**  
Learn to access and modify memory directly using pointers.

**Lore:**  
The apprentice now walks the Pointer’s Path, where memory is not just stored — it is bound and manipulated. This is the first step toward true systems sorcery.

**Concepts Unlocked:**
- `int* ptr` — declaring a pointer to an integer
- `&spell_power` — getting the memory address
- `*ptr` — dereferencing the pointer to access or modify the value
- `%p` — printing memory addresses

**Bonus Challenge:**  
Create a function that takes a pointer and modifies the value it points to. Use it to reforge multiple spell powers.
