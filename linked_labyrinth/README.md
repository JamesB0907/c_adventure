# The Linked Labyrinth

**Quest Objective:**  
Learn to create and traverse a linked list using `struct` and pointers.

**Lore:**  
The apprentice now binds entities into a living chain â€” each node pointing to the next. This is the foundation of dynamic data structures, memory traversal, and game entity systems.

**Concepts Unlocked:**
- Self-referential `struct` (`struct Entity* next`)
- Dynamic allocation of nodes
- Linked traversal using `while (current != NULL)`
- Manual memory release (`free`)

**Bonus Challenge:**  
Create a function to add a new entity to the end of the chain. Then allow the user to build a party interactively.
