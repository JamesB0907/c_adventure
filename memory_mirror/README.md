# The Memory Mirror

**Quest Objective:**  
Learn to store and retrieve multiple values using arrays.

**Lore:**  
The apprentice must conjure a mirror that holds many reflections. Each index reveals a stored echo of power, and the array becomes a spellbook of memory.

**Concepts Unlocked:**
- Arrays (`int spells[5]`) — fixed-size memory containers
- Indexing (`spells[i]`) — accessing specific reflections
- Looping through memory — combining loops with arrays

**Bonus Challenge:**  
Allow the user to choose how many spells to store (up to 100), then dynamically fill and review the array.
